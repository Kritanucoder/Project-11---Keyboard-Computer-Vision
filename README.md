# Project-11---Keyboard-Computer-Vision
This project develops an innovative virtual keyboard system that enables touchless typing through hand gesture recognition. Using CVZone's hand tracking capabilities and OpenCV, the system detects finger positions and pinch gestures to simulate keyboard input. The interface features a customizable QWERTY layout with special keys including space, backspace, and clear functions. Advanced interaction mechanics include hover effects, click animations, and cooldown periods to prevent accidental inputs. The system integrates with the operating system through pynput library for seamless text input across applications. Real-time visual feedback enhances user experience through color-coded key states and typed text display. This contactless input method offers significant benefits for accessibility, hygiene-conscious environments, and hands-free computing scenarios, demonstrating the potential of gesture-based human-computer interaction.
